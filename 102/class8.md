# Overview

Being familiar with operators and loops because it helps coders interact with users.  Creating the right code helps developers enhance the user experience through the right amount of nudging users need.

##  Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to their left operand based on the value of its right operand.

When expressions evaluate objects, the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression.

When expressions do not evaluate objects, assignments to properties of that expression don't get assigned.

In evaluation and nesting, assignments are used within a variable declaration, typically with **const**, **let**, or **var** or as standalone statements.

It's a good practice to avoid assignment chains in the same statement.  It'll just lead to headaches.  

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 

The operands vary by numerical, string, logical, or object values.
Javascript does its best conversion to align comparisons.

An easy way to think about control flow is like any structured tasks list.  Some things have to happen before others.  You can't just start blurting out a to do list if your team doesn't doesn't understand the logical flow of what needs to happen first versus last.

## Loops and Iteration

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly through coding.  It reduces the time the computer has to execute the same task multiple times.  

Loops are part of a flow control structure.

Simply put, looping keeps the coder from having to repeat themselves through a well thought out set of commands.

## Summary

Operators and loops in essence speed things up.  If the mantra holds true that good developers are lazy developers, opeartors and loops provide the essential time savers needed to prevent delays.
