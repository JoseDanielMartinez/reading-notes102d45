## Learning Javascript

It's important to learn Javascript because developers can use data provided by users to enhance their experiences.  It's also a way of incorporating fun features onto your website to make it less boring and more interesting.

To use another getting dressed for work analogy as for my CSS reading notes, knowing Javascript would make you more interesting after your dressed and styled.  It would be the next thing such as the way you speak and interact with others.  If you were a website, how many people would visit you at your cubby, seek your advice, or ask you to go to lunch that day.  That's what Javascript can do for websites...makes them more interesting and intriguing.
