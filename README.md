# Hello my name is Jose D. Martinez and I am learning to code

A **growth mindset** to me means there's always more to learn regardless of where you are in life.  It is about expanding knowledge beyond what you thought was possible.  

3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

1. Love learning.  Challenge yourself to inquire about new subject areas.  You won't be an expert but you'll be able to expand on more topics than before.
2. Expand news mediums.  Seek differing ways to learn.  Read, listen to podcasts, and think about taking in a Ted talk from time to time.  Fresh takes on new areas expands our views.
3. Grow social networks.  Follow similar and disimilar celebrity personalities on social media. Listen to what they are saying and how it impacts you and your world.
