Reading journal for my notes
# Hello my name is Jose D. Martinez and I am learning to code

I recently retired from the military after 20+ years of service.  Learning to code is a new endeavour I look forward to mastering.  I'll have to find time for class here in Southern Florida between all the fishing, lounging, and beach time.  It'll be a challenge to say the least!

A ***growth mindset*** to me means there's always more to learn regardless of where you are in life.  It is about expanding knowledge beyond what you thought was possible.  

3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

1. **Love learning**.  Challenge yourself to inquire about new subject areas.  You won't be an expert but you'll be able to expand on more topics than before.
2. **Expand news mediums**.  Seek differing ways to learn.  Read, listen to podcasts, and think about taking in a Ted talk from time to time.  Fresh takes on new areas expands our views.
3. **Grow social networks**.  Follow similar and disimilar celebrity personalities on social media. Listen to what they are saying and how it impacts you and your world.

# The sky's the limit with a growth mindset!
